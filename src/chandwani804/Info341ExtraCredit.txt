Unique things that Eva says:
 command> he spoke not a
Eva Tar: He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
 Eva Tar: And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
 Eva Tar: He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
command> status twas the night before christmas
command> Eva Tar: I know 'The Night Before Christmas' by heart! ... Well, sometimes I need help.




command> status can you please tell me the night before christmas?
command> status can you recite the night before christmas?
command> Eva Tar: Oh, yeah, now I remember ...
Eva Tar: Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;


command> status The stockings were hung
command> Eva Tar: The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;


command> status The children were nestled
command> Eva Tar: The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;


command> status And mamma in her
command> Eva Tar: And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,


Eva Tar: When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
command> status away
command> Eva Tar: Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
Eva Tar: The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow, Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,


command> Eva Tar: When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,


command> status With a little old driver
command> 
Eva Tar: With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
command> 
command> Eva Tar: More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
Eva Tar: Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen!
Eva Tar: To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!


command> status As dry leaves that
command> Eva Tar: As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,
Eva Tar: So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.
Eva Tar: And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
Eva Tar: As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
Eva Tar: He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
Eva Tar: A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.


command> 
command> status his eyes
command> Eva Tar: His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
Eva Tar: His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
Eva Tar: The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
Eva Tar: He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.
Eva Tar: He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
Eva Tar: A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
